**Description**
In Piaget's [[1. Nodes/dissipative structures\|dissipative structures]] model, when a complex system is far from equilibrium, it enters what is called a [[transition zone\|transition zone]], creating instability. As the "flow of energy" increases, it results in the **bifurcation** of the system. At this point, a massive reorganization occurs, resulting in the emergence of new structures for coherence and efficiency. Fosnot states that "Without dissipative structures (bifurcating), without exchange with the environment, entropy would result."

> **Quotes**
> Before self-order and complexity can evolve, they are one with their environment. The time between the emergence of the chaotic environment that leads to bifurcations and novel structures and a preceding time of stasis is a transition zone (Fosnot. C, p. 13)
