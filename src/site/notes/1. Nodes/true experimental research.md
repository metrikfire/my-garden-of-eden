**Definition**
A research design that involves the use of an intervention, plus random assignment of participants to groups. Recommended for testing cause and effect relationships. 

**Notes**:
All three types (research designs) involve an experimental manipulation, but only true experimental designs use the random assignment that greatly facilitates ability to uncover cause-and-effect relationships. (Suter, 2012, Ch. 10, pg. 3)

 true experimental design, therefore, is one that incorporates a true independent variable. You will also recall from Chapter 5 that a manipulation refers to the creation of group conditions by the researcher. In its most basic form, a manipulation would include a treatment group and a control group. (Suter. 2012, Ch.10)

true experimental research designs include the following: 
[[randomized posttest control group \|randomized posttest control group ]]design 
[[1. Nodes/randomized pretest-posttest control group\|randomized pretest-posttest control group]] design 
randomized [[1. Nodes/matched control group\|matched control group]] design 
[[1. Nodes/randomized factorial design\|randomized factorial design]] (Suter. 2012, Ch. 10)

True experimental designs, especially those with clever control groups, are **well suited to ferret out cause-and-effect relationships because of the power of random assignment** of subjects to treatment and control groups. (Suter, 2012, Ch. 10)

True experimental designs, **despite their potential, can still yield ambiguous findings due to many sources of bias and confounding, poor instrumentation (measurement), inadequate sampling, and so on**. In other words, alternative hypotheses may be still be present, and usually are, within true experimental research. (Suter, 2012, Ch. 10, pg. 7)
Considerations:
- downsides of this design
- is it bias to prefer this design?

True experimental designs in education combine an independent variable (a manipulation) with random assignment. They are well suited for uncovering cause-andeffect relationships when a research question focuses on testing treatment or intervention effects. **Many specific designs exist, yet they share a defining characteristic: a [[true independent variable\|true independent variable]].** (Suter, 2012, Ch. 10, pg. 12)

True experimental designs **incorporate a manipulation with random assignment to groups** (e.g., the randomized posttest control group design). The **strength of the true experimental design is highlighted by its contrast to “[[1. Nodes/preexperimental design\|preexperimental design]]”  that have very little control over threatening influences**. True experimental factorial designs are especially useful, for **they yield information about main (overall) effects as well as interactive (nonadditive, “compounding”) effects**.
