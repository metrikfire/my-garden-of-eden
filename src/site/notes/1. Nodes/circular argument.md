**Description**
Epistemic circularity defends the reliability of a source of belief, by relying on the premises that are themselves, based on the source. As part of [[1. Nodes/Agrippa’s Trilemma\|Agrippa’s Trilemma]], epistemically circular arguments are considered epistemological problems. Thus there seems to be no completely satisfactory solution to the problem of epistemic circularity. This suggests that the ancient problem of the criterion is a genuine skeptical paradox.
