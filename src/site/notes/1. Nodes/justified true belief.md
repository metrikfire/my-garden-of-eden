**Description**
Often used to define "knowledge". Also referred to simply as *justification* or *epistemic justification*.
There are three essential features of JTB:
*S* knows that *p* if and only if (1)*p* is true, (2)*S* believes that *p*, and (3) this belief is [^1]justiified.

Most philosophers agree that 1 and 2 are correct or valid, but 3 leaves a lot of room for ambiguity. Thus posited by the [[1. Nodes/Gettier’s problem\|Gettier’s problem]] which reveals how all 3 criterion can be met and still have no mean when it comes to "having" or "gained" knowledge.
