**Definition**
Also known as **know-how**, sometimes referred to as **practical knowledge**. Involves one's ability to do something. A person does not need to be verbally articulate for it to be considered procedural knowledge. 

Procedural knowledge is not considered widely generalizable because it indicates the ability to execute a series of action sequences to solve a problem, thus being considered goal oriented in service of problem solving.[^1]

Deep procedural knowledge vs superficial: deep procedural knowledge is associated with comprehension, flexibility and critical judgement, assessing contextual and environmental information with relation to each step in the procedure.
