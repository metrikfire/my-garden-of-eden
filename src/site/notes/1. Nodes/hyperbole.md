**Description**
A hyperbole is a gross exaggeration into caricature-like description to further emphasize the intention or to add gravity and intensity to the sentiment 

**Annotated examples**
>“And I understood finally that a nation is a house with no windows or doors at all. That no matter what I did— **no matter how much blood I spilled in its defense or ink I spent in its praise**— it would never, ever be my home.” (See also: [[⛓️‍💥anaphora\|⛓️‍💥anaphora]], [[symbolism\|symbolism]]) — *Harrow. A, [[4. Artifacts/The Everlasting\|The Everlasting]]*
>
>*Effect: The irony of this hyperbole is that it is in fact, literally what Owen Mallory does in the story— he fights a war in which he kills many people and nearly dies, then writes a giant propaganda mythology to fan Dominion’s nationalist flames.

> A sound like someone falling through air without ever touching ground, her voice pierced the thin walls with the hellish mix of a yodel and a howl.
> ~ Vuong. O, The Emperor of Gladness, pg. 31
