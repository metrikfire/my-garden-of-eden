**Description**
The dogmatic argument is an epistemological problem that exists as part of [[1. Nodes/Agrippa’s Trilemma\|Agrippa’s Trilemma]]. It points out the flaw in [[1. Nodes/justification\|justification]] by claiming that at some point, justification of belief cannot be upheld by justification alone, and thus leads to the [[1. Nodes/foundationalism\|foundationalism]] account of knowledge.
