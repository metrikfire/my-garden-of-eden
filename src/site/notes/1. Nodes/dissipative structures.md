**Description**
In Constructivist Theory Perspectives, dissipative structures are described as conceptual nodes within a system that produce new forms of order— order that arises spontaneously in a complex system when it is far from equilibrium, at “the edge of the chaos.” Piaget states that "For cells to live, evolve, and flourish, there must be an exchange of matter and energy with the environment around them."(Fosnot. C, pg. 13) 

When the flow of energy increases, the increased activity produces instability and a “[[1. Nodes/bifurcation\|bifurcation]]” results. At this [[1. Nodes/bifurcation\|bifurcation]] point, reorganizing occurs—self-organizing that results in the emergence of a new structure for coherence and efficiency. Without **dissipative structures**, without exchange with the environment, entropy would result.

> **Quotes**
> This spontaneous emergence of order at critical points of instability is one of the most important concepts of the new understanding of life. It is technically known as self-organization and is often referred to simply as “emergence.” It has been recognized as the dynamic origin of development, learning, and evolution. In other words, creativity—the generation of new forms—is a key property of all living systems. And since emergence is an integral part of dynamics of open systems, we reach the important conclusion that open systems develop and evolve. Life constantly reaches out into novelty.
