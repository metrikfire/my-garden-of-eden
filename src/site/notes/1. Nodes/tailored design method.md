**Definition**: - 
**Notes**
This methodology is designed to maximize response rate (up to the desirable level of .70 or higher) via the Internet or traditional methods and includes practical suggestions for crafting questions, sampling respondents, deciding on the mode of data collection, and analyzing data in ways that minimize bias and maximize the validity of responses. (Suter, Ch. 11, pg 23)

The tailored design method (TDM) is rooted in theory—social exchange theory—that predicts high rates of return when selected participants' perceptions of benefits from responding outweigh the cost of responding.

Several recommendations for instrument development and implementation based on TDM are provided by Cui (2003) and appear below: 
- Minimize length (and the perception of length)
• Maximize interest 
• Maximize ease 
• Maximize trust ( credible sponsor ) 
• Place a high-interest question at the beginning 
• Use graphics where appropriate 
• Select a font and format that ease reading 
• Assure respondents of confidentiality or anonymity 
• Highlight the importance of the survey 
• Personalize the request as much as possible 
• Plan for multiple communications 
• Pretest the survey and revise accordingly
