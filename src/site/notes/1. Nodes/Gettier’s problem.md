**Description**
A thought experiment by Edmud Gettier to disprove the [[1. Nodes/justified true belief\|justified true belief]] account of knowledge. 

Gettier's paper used counterexamples to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and [[1. Nodes/justification\|justified]]—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by "knowledge".

Gettier's case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis, both involving a fictional character named Smith. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by entailment, and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith's putative "belief". That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would _also_ be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples "Case I" and "Case II"
