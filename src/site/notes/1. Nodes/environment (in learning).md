**Description**
Fosnot claims that whenever we focus our attention on a particular item, **environment** refers to the surroundings of the item we have isolated, and we tend to forget that both the item and its surroundings are parts of our own experiential field, not an observer-independent objective world. (Fosnot. C, pg. 4)
Additionally, when we intend to stimulate and enhance a student’s learning, we cannot afford to forget that knowledge does not exist outside a person’s mind.

**Quotes**
> Too often teaching strategies and procedures seem to spring from the naive assumption that what we ourselves perceive and infer from our perceptions is there, readymade, for the students to pick up, if only they had the will to do so.
