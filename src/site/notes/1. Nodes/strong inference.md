**Definition**:
Strong inference: A concept referring to the test of a research hypothesis against an alternative (rival) hypothesis. Strong inference designs permit the elimination of at least one competing explanation (while supporting another).

**Notes**
We know that the basic [[causal comparative research \|causal comparative research ]]design frequently lacks strong controls for alternative hypotheses. This design can, however, be greatly strengthened by testing a plausible, rival explanation against the research hypothesis. The concept of a design that tests a research hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis (or one that “pits” two explanations against each other) is called strong inference (Platt, 1964) and is one mark of a good research design.
