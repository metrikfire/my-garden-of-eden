**Description**
The claim that some beliefs are known or justifiably believed because some other beliefs are known or justifiably believed. Foundationalism is an account of knowledge that address the epistemological problem of [[1. Nodes/dogmatic argument\|dogmatic argument]], which exists as part of  [[1. Nodes/Agrippa’s Trilemma\|Agrippa’s Trilemma]]. In essence, it claims that at some point, some belief is inherently and intrinsically self justified. 

**Examples**
Belief:

> “I am in pain.”

Foundation:

- This belief is **non-inferentially justified**
- You do not infer it from evidence—it is immediately known

Other beliefs follow:

- “I should stop running.”
- “I am injured.”
This is often used to motivate **internalist foundationalism**.
