**Description**
**Equilibration** was described by Piaget as a dynamic process of self-regulated behavior balancing two intrinsic polar behaviors, [[assimilation\|assimilation]] and [[accommodation\|accommodation]]. Assimilation (to make similar) is activity, the organization of experience; it is the individual’s self-assertive tendency, a tendency to view, understand, and act on the “surround” with one’s own activity or ideas in order to preserve one’s autonomy as a part within a whole system.

According to Piaget, an organism (or system) attempts to conserve its previously held behaviors and/or beliefs and thus "new situations" eventually result in an accommodation due to the effects or pressures of the environment.  And in this process, the organism [[1. Nodes/second order coupling\|couples]] with its surround.

> **Quotes**
> Equilibration has often been misinterpreted in the literature. It is not a sequential process of assimilation, then conflict, then accommodation; it is not linear. Nor is assimilation a process of “taking in information” as it has sometimes been described. Equilibration is instead a nonlinear, dynamic “dance’ of progressive equilibria, adaptation and organization, growth and change.
