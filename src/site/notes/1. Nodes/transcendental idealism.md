**Description**
Primarily prescribed by Immanuel Kant, who states that *while* we can't have direct experiential knowledge of the external world, we must assume it exists to make sense of our sensory experiences. He believes that much of what we perceive (time and space) is structured by our minds. 

This means our experiences are shaped by inherent cognitive frameworks.
