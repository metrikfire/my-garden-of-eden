**Description**
The "Argument from Illusion" is a philosophical concept under the [[1. Nodes/perceptual knowledge\|perceptual knowledge]] claim that suggests our perceptual experiences can be misleading. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Basic Idea**: It posits that there are cases where our senses deceive us, leading us to perceive something that isn’t actually there. For example, seeing a stick appear bent in water.
2. **Implication**: If we can have indistinguishable experiences such as seeing a mirage of an oasis versus a real oasis then it raises doubts about whether we can truly know the external world.
3. **Conclusion**: This argument supports [[1. Nodes/indirect realism\|indirect realism]], which claims that we don't directly perceive the world itself but rather our sensory impressions of it. Thus, we must infer what the world is like based on these impressions.

In essence, the argument highlights the indirect nature of our knowledge of the world, suggesting that we might never fully access reality as it is.
