  **Description**
 Epistemic rationality differs from instrumental (or practical) rationality in that it considers the entirety of one's knowledge and thus must not ignore 'truth' or 'reality'. [[1. Nodes/instrumental rationality\|instrumental rationality]] however, is concerned with actions that effectively achieve desired outcomes, not requiring the 'reality' factor to be an aspect of one's personal rationale. 

**Notes**
In order to engage with epistemological thought with the most rational possible way, one should have as many true beliefs as possible. To which end, one would try to believe as many truths as possible (aka. an edgelord). However, counterintuitively, you also include false beliefs in this method, and thus it is counter productive to 'believe everything'. Instead, engaging with sincerity in the epistemic requirement for true beliefs would require us to *minimize false beliefs*, thus it would behoove us to exercise balance and caution in weighing true beliefs and false beliefs (lol)

**Deontic epistemic rationality**
holds that a believer is epistemically rational *if and only if* the believer is epistemically permitted, required or not blameworthy in holding it. As in, following the epistemic norm in context. 

> **The key question it answers**
Deontic epistemic rationality asks:
> **“Given what I had access to, _ought_ I to believe this?”**

 Not: 
  Is the belief true?
  > Is it reliably produced?
But:
> -  Did I violate any epistemic duties?
