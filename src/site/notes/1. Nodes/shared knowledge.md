**Description**
*also: shared meanings*

Fosnot claims that conceptual structures that constitute meanings or knowledge are not something that exists in the ether and can be "shared" with two different minds (see: [[1. Nodes/problem of other minds\|problem of other minds]]) but instead they are constructs that each user has to build up for him- or herself. (pg. 4)

> 2. 1. For it is one thing to assert that, as far as one’s experience goes, the meaning others attribute to a word seems to be compatible with one’s own, but quite another to assume that it has to be the same.
