**Definition**
“Henceforth, when we talk about knowledge, we will have [[1. Nodes/propositional knowledge\|propositional knowledge]] in mind, unless explicitly stated otherwise.” - Pritchard, 2014, Ch. 1, pg. 14
“Two things that just about every epistemologist agrees on are that a prerequisite for possessing knowledge is that one has a belief in the relevant proposition, and that that belief must be true. ”
“In particular, I’m going to assume that truth is objective in the following sense: at least for most propositions, your thinking that they are true does not make them true. Whether or not the earth is round, for example, has nothing”

# Further notes from conversations with Chappie

```
I have a question that addresses some fundamental gaps in the language of this textbook and epistemology at large: that is, how is Pritchard, in particular, utilizing the word "know"? as in more concretely, is he saying that 'to know AB' means to have a justified belief and that belief to be true?
```

> This is an excellent question—and you’re absolutely right to flag it as a **linguistic and conceptual gap** rather than a simple definitional issue. You’re basically asking: _what work is the word “know” actually doing in Pritchard’s framework?_ Let’s be very precise.

## Short answer (but not glib)

**No**—Pritchard is _not_ simply using “know” to mean [[1. Nodes/justified true belief\|justified true belief]](JTB), and in fact much of _What Is This Thing Called Knowledge?_ is structured to show **why that equation fails** and what must replace it.
But he also doesn’t abandon truth, belief, or justification. He **reconfigures their roles**.

---
## Step 1: What Pritchard is _not_ doing
Pritchard does **not** treat “knows that p” as shorthand for:

> S believes p  
> p is true  
> S has justification for p

That classical Platonic/JTB gloss is introduced **as a starting point**, not as his working definition. He explicitly accepts the Gettier problem as decisive:  

👉 _Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge._

So when Pritchard says “S knows p,” he is **not** merely saying “S has a JTB.”

---
## Step 2: What “know” _minimally_ commits him to
Across the book, “know” is treated as a **success term**, which means:
- **Truth is non-negotiable**  
    If p is false, S does not know p.
- **Belief is required**  
    One cannot know p without believing p.
So at minimum:
> Knowledge = true belief + something else

That “something else” is where all the philosophical action is.

---
## Step 3: Why justification is _not_ the whole story
Pritchard is careful with the term **[[1. Nodes/justification\|justification]]**, because it does two different jobs in epistemology:
1. **Internalist justification**  
    – reasons the subject can access reflectively
2. **Externalist justification**  
    – reliability, safety, or truth-tracking features of the belief-forming process
    
He argues that **neither alone is sufficient**.
- Pure internalism → [[1. Nodes/Gettier’s problem\|Gettier]] vulnerability
- Pure externalism → epistemic luck, loss of rational agency
    
So when Pritchard uses “know,” he is **not** committed to justification in the traditional internalist sense.

---
## Step 4: Pritchard’s positive view (simplified but accurate)
Pritchard ultimately endorses a **hybrid account** that combines:
### 1. Anti-luck condition
Knowledge must not be true _by luck_  
(usually cashed out as a **safety** condition)
### 2. Epistemic ability / virtue
The belief must arise from the agent’s cognitive abilities
### 3. Reflective access (in perceptual cases)
In good cases, the subject can know _why_ they know

This is where **epistemic disjunctivism** comes in.

---
## Step 5: What “know” means _operationally_ for Pritchard
A good working gloss—much closer to what he’s doing than JTB—is something like:
> S knows that p if and only if  
> p is true,  
> S believes p,  
> S’s belief is the product of reliable cognitive abilities,  
> S’s belief is safe from error,  
> and (in paradigm cases) S has reflectively accessible, factive reasons for p.

This is **not** a formal definition he gives—but it tracks how he uses the term throughout the book.

---
## Step 6: Why this matters for scepticism and closure
This answers your earlier worries about [[1. Nodes/closure principle\|closure]].
When Pritchard says:
> “If S knows p…”

he is **not** saying:
> “If S has a justified true belief that p…”

He is saying:
> “If S is in a non-lucky, ability-exercising, truth-entailing epistemic position with respect to p…”

That’s why [[sceptical hypothesis\|sceptical hypothesis]] matter so much:
- They threaten **safety**
- They threaten **reflective access**
- They threaten **non-luck**
Closure becomes dangerous _because_ “know” is this strong success term.

---
## Step 7: Why the textbook can feel linguistically slippery
You’re absolutely right to feel that there’s a gap here.
Pritchard deliberately:
- uses ordinary “know” language
- avoids premature formal definitions
- lets competing theories pressure the term from different angles

This pedagogical choice can make it feel like:
> “Wait—what exactly are we talking about when we say ‘know’?”

But that’s intentional: the book is showing that **no single traditional definition survives scrutiny**, while still insisting that “knowledge” is a real and important category.

---
## Bottom line
To answer your question directly:
- ❌ Pritchard is _not_ using “know” to mean justified true belief
- ✅ He treats knowledge as true belief plus anti-luck, ability, and (in key cases) reflectively accessible reasons
- ✅ “Know” is a **success term**, not merely an epistemic attitude
- ✅ The apparent vagueness is part of the philosophical work the book is doing
