**Description**
Research design refers to the overall strategy utilized to answer research questions. A research design typically outlines the theories and models underlying a project; the research question(s) of a project; a strategy for gathering data and information; and a strategy for producing answers from the data.

he design of a study defines the study type (descriptive, [[1. Nodes/correlational research\|correlational research]], [[1. Nodes/quasi-experimental research\|quasi-experimental research]], [[1. Nodes/experimental research\|experimental research]], review, meta-analytic) and sub-type (e.g., descriptive-longitudinal case study), research problem, hypotheses, independent and dependent variables, experimental design, and, if applicable, data collection methods and a statistical analysis plan. A research design is a framework that has been created to find answers to research questions.
