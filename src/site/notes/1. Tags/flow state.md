**Definition**
**Flow** in [positive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology "Positive psychology"), also known colloquially as being **in** **the zone** or **locked in**, is the [mental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state "Mental state") in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention "Attention"), full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time. Flow is the melting together of action and [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"); the state of finding a balance between a skill and how challenging that task is. It requires a high level of concentration. Flow is used as a [coping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping "Coping") skill for stress and anxiety when productively pursuing a form of leisure that matches one's skill set.
