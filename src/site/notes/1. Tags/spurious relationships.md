**Definition**:
Spurious relationship: A relationship than can be “explained away” by reference to another variable. When a connection between A and B is due solely to their both being caused by C, it is said that the relationship between A and B is spurious (or “false”). 

A spurious relationship in research design refers to a situation where two variables appear to be related but are not causally linked. This misleading association often arises due to the influence of a third variable, known as a [[1. Tags/confound\|confound]]ing variable.
