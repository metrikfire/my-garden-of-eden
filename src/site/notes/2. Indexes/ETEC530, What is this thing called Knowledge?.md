## What is knowledge in philosophy?

The classical account of knowledge stemming from the Platonic dialogues, postulates that in having "good reasons" for what one believes is true qualifies them as knowledgeable or in possession of knowledge. Pritchard goes on to state that based on this premise, it might suffice to say that one believes the earth is flat because they are walking on a flat ground, and this would be considered 'having knowledge' - without the consideration of a third variable that might quickly render such true belief invalid, which might be a telescope, or a flight out into the stratosphere.

In this way, true belief, Pritchard says, is considered highly unstable. Thus also its instrumental value is questionable as it resists empirical validation due to its volatile nature. [[1. Nodes/Gettier’s problem\|Gettier’s problem]] quickly also dispels the Platonic classical account of knowledge by hypothesizing the contextual alignment of certain situations that result in the validation of JTB's criteria but still holds meaningless when it comes to any knowledge having been possessed, used or verified.

The fallacy of [[1. Nodes/justified true belief\|justified true belief]] in real world application is immediately visible in EFL education, when students who may believe that the textbook at school that is government mandated, is vetted, reliable and relevant. Which is usually the case, in most other subjects. However, for EFL, let's say the MoE hires unqualified curriculum designers based on nepotistic practices, who choose textbooks at random and it just so happens that, the textbooks chosen by the designers for Grade 1 junior high school are written by qualified, leading experts and is academically sound. This may nor may not be repeated for the other grades. 

In such case, does the unreliability of the people involved at a higher level disqualify the knowledge that is now proliferated via questionable curriculum choices?

Do these contextual variables disqualify knowledge from being transferred or from being acquired? Do bad actors diminish the entire educational institution because they have acted in bad faith?

Finally, what does it mean to codify something nebulous such as "language" into a textbook and consider it "knowledge"?

## Why is justification important?
