# Digital video games and Language Learners’ Vocabulary learning, motivation and engagement: Teachers’ perceptions of types and effectiveness 

**Summary**
The research questions being addressed in this study were as follows: 
1. What are the most commonly used online digital video games for English vocabulary  learning among young language learners, according to language teachers? 
2. According to language teachers, how effective are these games for improving English  vocabulary among young language learners? 
3. What factors influence teachers' selection of online digital video games for English  vocabulary learning among young language learners, such as game design, learner  preferences, and educational objectives? (Alibakshi et al., 2025)

**Methodology**:
- semi-structured interviews to collect data which were designed with open ended questions and prompts in order to prompt teachers into sharing views, experiences, perceptions and learning contexts of their use of digital games in their classrooms. 
- Data such as audio recordings, transcriptions and field notes were organized and coded in order to extract themes and patterns. 
- Themes and patterns were then mined through an open coding system
- Key concepts and ideas were extracted from the derived codes which were utilized to form links and excerpts in relation to the research questions, thus forming a coherent narrative presented in the article.
- Findings revealed that teachers had positive experiences with the employment of digital games in EFL classes, citing programs such as Kahoot! and Quizlet as effective applications. They enjoyed structured learning formats, instantaneous feedback and the collaborative-competitve aspect of digital games. 
-  Participant thoughts on question one with the following quote:  “Quizlet is a very effective tool for teaching vocabulary. My students love the flashcards  and the games that come with it. They can play individually or as a group, and they get  to see their progress in real-time. It's a fun and engaging way for them to learn and  practice vocabulary" 
- Accessibility, flexibility, cost, social adaptability, integration and learning effectiveness were primary factors in considering if a program was suitable.
  "I look for games that are accessible to all my students, regardless of their access to technology. I want the game to be easily accessible and user-friendly for everyone." -Teacher 2 (Alibakshi et al., 2025, p. 11)


**Reflections**
I could wean the article's methodologies and research questions quickly, which it offered with clarity and transparency. I skimmed to find its proposed limitations and found that Alibakshi et al. were candid and insightful in the blind spots inherent to the scope and design of the study (2025, p. 15), identifying the areas of future research with honesty as well as curiosity. Despite the several unanswered questions inherent to the study design, Alibakshi et.al were able to stay focused on their research questions, keeping the data analysis process flexible, lean and uncomplicated. The researchers identified three subgroups within the sample size: gender, age and teaching experience (Alibakishi et al., 2025, pg 6)

Having read through their process of interviewing, comprehending what or how they have utilized open coding to associate over-arching concepts to themes and patterns, seemed to me like a laborious exercise in patience and curiosity. It was immensely enjoyable to read and I think this aspect of "listen and learn" might be a quirk required in the conducting researcher as it definitely requires a specific skill set to be able to coax participants to be candid and non-performative.
