While reading 'The Cookie' from their textbook today, Grade 2-2 struggled with thought organization (in JP) and were unable to successfully predict the comic panel they were looking at. The JTE expressed this after she read through the predictions and suggested we try a brainstorming activity through which students must explain choose any panel and explain it in a single sentence. 
After which we consolidate it by organizing it into either a) flow of events or b) cause / effect
I think this is promising way to build their metacognitive faculties. I'm interested to see how we might possible be able to evaluate the effectiveness of this hypothesis. Perhaps I can utilize this opportunity to set the activity as an interference factor and set up a null hypothesis. I'll come back to this note and extrapolate this further.
