# 3. Notes
This research study considers the impact of MALL or mobile assisted language learning apps and its impact on elementary school students EFL classrooms. The article states that EFL in Japan has seen a drastic shift from repetitive teacher-driven learning to a more self sustained and self-directed form of learning. (Hori et al., 2025, p. 1852) It includes digital textbooks in the study, contrasting from MALL apps by defining it as "*digital objects containing text and other content, with commonly available features such as search and cross-reference functions, hypertext links, bookmarks, annotations, highlighting, multimedia objects and interactive tools*" (Hori et al., 2025, p. 1853) The study considered elementary school students aged six to eight at a private school in Osaka. 

Some of the literature they were basing their study design on anticipated increased psychological stimulation in order to trigger flow state which would in turn, increase [[1. Tags/self determination theory\|intrinsic motivation, competence and a desire for autonomy]]. (2025, p1853)

The study provides some recommended applications of MALL apps by expressing that rote memorization and drills are ineffective and that having autonomy to manipulate the learning environment, providing a higher degree of control and being given feedback on learning activities (2025, p. 1859) will ensure higher rates of success. 

The study also lists several limitations, ranging from the small sampling to the short timespan in which the study was conducted, adding a disclaimer that long term learning might yield different results for M-learning.
# 4. Reflection

An important note that came to me while reading this paper was that MALL apps were effective potentially because of its gamified aspects of learning, compared to digital textbooks. While digital textbooks had all the trappings of an interactive experience, it lacks the game aspect (*you need to define this better*) to activate the intrinsic motivation required for [[1. Tags/flow state\|flow state]].  
Additionally, utilizing this in a classroom setting has its limitations as achieving flow state in a classroom setting is near impossible. Thus the use of MALL apps must be considered in the environment it is used in. Perhaps instead of integrating MALL apps into classroom application, it might be more useful to think about what aspects of MALL apps can be integrated into digital text books.
