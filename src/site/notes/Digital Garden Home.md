# How to use the digital garden,

This garden functions similarly to a wiki. You can start by choosing a concept under Tags and follow its trail through the graph in the right side bar. The graph allows you to control it's depth of connection to view analogous ideas.

You can also use the *Search* bar to do a quick scan if there is a specific node you might be interested in. 

Enjoy your stay!
