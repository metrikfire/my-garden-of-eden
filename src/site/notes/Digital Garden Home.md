# How to use the digital garden,

This garden functions similarly to a wiki. You can start by choosing a concept under **Tags** and follow its trail through the graph in the right side bar. The **graph** allows you to control it's depth of connection to view analogous ideas. Or you can start from **Indexes**, which are umbrella spaces that encapsulate a multitude of tags. 

You can also use the *Search* bar to do a quick scan if there is a specific node you might be interested in. 

**Indexes** will allow you to see related artifacts such as journal articles, videos or related fleeting notes under a single umbrella, usually a textbook chapter or a recurring category.

**Artifacts** refer to specific media formats that the tags were retrieved out of. This is how new tags are created, usually by me consuming some form of information via video or text and needing to process information

Enjoy your stay!
