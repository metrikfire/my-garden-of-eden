# How to use the digital garden,

This garden functions similarly to a wiki, designed to be highly retrievable and optimized for connecting nodes of thought. 

You can start by choosing a keyword under **Nodes** and follow its trail through the graph in the right side bar. The **graph** allows you to control it's depth of connection to view analogous ideas. Or you can start from **Indexes**, which are container spaces that encapsulate a multitude of nodes. Indexes are basically a lazy way for me to aggregate artifacts which are viewable via *Linked Mentions*, but sometimes they get too unwieldy without any organizational structure, hence they become **Clusters**. Clusters will visually organize linked artifacts into a drawer of sorts. 

**Artifacts** refer to specific media formats that the nodes were extracted out of. This is how new nodes are created, usually by me consuming some form of information via video or text and needing to process information. Conversely, some artifacts are also ones that I have created, either for grad school purposes or simply because I needed it to exist here.

You can also use the *Search* bar to do a quick scan if there is a specific node you might be interested in. 

Enjoy your stay and hope you find something interesting!
