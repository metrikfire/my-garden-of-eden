### A digital garden is an online space where you can collect and develop your ideas over time, similar to a personal wiki or a notebook. 

This specific garden is an extension of Melissa's work in the ed-tech space. Please refer to <a href="https://www.hellomeishang.io">the journal</a> for more personal work.
