#### page 1
-> By  understanding teachers' perceptions, this study contributes to the  pedagogical implications of digital video games in language  education and informs future practices in vocabulary instruction. 
#### page 2 (background and review)
-> Furthermore, digital games can  provide a safe and low-stress environment for learners to practice their language skills, which  can help reduce anxiety and increase motivation (Aghlara andTamjid, 2011; Ashraf, Motlagh,  and Salami, 2014; Bakhsh, 2016; Gee, 2018; Wu, Zhang, & Wang, 2020).

-> For instance, Amazon introduced the AWS  Cloud Quest Game to help users acquire cloud computing skills in an enjoyable manner  (Amazon, 2022). 

-> "Consequently, educational video games must be  enjoyable to sustain user motivation while providing educational value."

-> If a game fails to be  sufficiently entertaining or motivating, user engagement, particularly in unsupervised settings,  may decline (Banyte & Gadeikiene, 2015).

-> By building on this existing research, we can better understand the potential  of digital games for improving English vocabulary for young language learners and provide  practical recommendations for educators. 

-> While the study may provide valuable insights  into the most suitable games for improving English vocabulary, the reasons certain games are  preferred over others may still need to be explored.

-> Future research could focus on  understanding the underlying factors that shape teachers' perspectives on game-based learning,  such as their beliefs about learning, teaching, and technology, their level of comfort and  familiarity with digital games, and their experience and training in using game-based  approaches in the classroom (Tsai & Tsai, 2018).

-> Additionally, research could investigate how  teachers' perspectives are influenced by contextual factors, such as the availability of  technology and resources, the curriculum and learning objectives, and the learners' age,

-> 3. What factors influence teachers' selection of online digital video games for English  vocabulary learning among young language learners, such as game design, learner  preferences, and educational objectives? **Research Question 3**

-> This study is deeply rooted in Socio-Cultural Theory and Cognitive loading theory.

-> Games provide a  platform where learners interact socially, collaborate with peers, and use language for  communication and problem-solving (Thompson, 2013).

-> These interactions facilitate  vocabulary acquisition as learners negotiate meaning, share knowledge, and co-construct  understanding within the virtual worlds of the games.

-> Socio-cultural theory also underscores  the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), where learners can engage with  language just beyond their current capabilities with the guidance of more knowledgeable others,  such as teachers or more experienced players (Schilhab & Esbensen, 2019). 
#### page 5
-> Garris et al. (2002) proposed a research and practice model for using games to enhance  motivation and learning.

-> Furthermore, they proposed a model that includes three components: game design, learner  characteristics, and learning outcomes.

-> In terms of game design, they highlighted the  importance of challenges, interactivity, and feedback.

-> For learner characteristics, they  emphasized motivation, self-efficacy, and personality.

-> Finally, they mentioned knowledge  acquisition, skill development, and transfer for learning outcomes. 

-> In their framework for gamifying  educational experiences, they emphasized the importance of game elements such as points,  badges, and leaderboards and motivational factors such as [[1. Nodes/self determination theory\| autonomy, relatedness, and  competence]]. 
#### page 6  (research design)
-> Specifically, the study aimed to understand  how digital games can enhance teachers' motivation, engagement, and vocabulary teaching  outcomes.

-> The study included three main components: participants, instruments, and data  collection and analysis procedure. 

-> A qualitative case study is a research approach that delves deeply into a specific  phenomenon, context, or individual case to comprehensively understand its complexities and  nuances.

-> Through in-depth exploration and analysis of qualitative data, such as interviews,  observations, and documents, a qualitative case study seeks to uncover rich insights and  generate contextually relevant knowledge (Cohen et al., 2018).

-> The research utilized semistructured interviews to collect data from language educators. 

-> The participants in this study were 12 males (n=5) and females (n=7) EFL teachers who were  teaching English at a language school in a non-English speaking country, Tehran, Iran.

-> In terms  of age, the distribution spans across three categories: 30-40 years (n = 4), 25-30 years (n = 5),  and 30 years and above (n = 3).

-> Regarding teaching experience, participants are segmented into  three groups: 5-10 years (n = 4), 10-15 years (n = 6), and 15-20 years (n = 2).
#### page 7 (research design)
-> It included open-ended questions and prompts designed to elicit teachers'  views, experiences, and perceptions regarding the use of digital video games in the language  learning context.

-> The researchers selected a sample of teachers who were  knowledgeable about language learning and had experience with using digital video games in  their teaching.

-> This typically involved the organization of audio recordings, transcriptions, and  any field notes taken during the interviews.

-> This plan detailed how the transcribed interviews would be analyzed, coded,  and interpreted to identify themes and patterns in teachers' perceptions of the types and  effectiveness of digital video games in vocabulary learning.

-> Then, open coding was applied, involving the generation of initial codes  that captured key ideas and concepts from the data.

-> These themes  were supported by relevant excerpts from the interview transcripts, lending credibility to the  findings.
