## Movie Review: Annihilation
I recall Annihilation as a disturbing foray into uncharted epistemological boundaries when I first watched it almost a decade ago. I decided to revisit the film with a more critical lens and a deeper interest in the epistemological implications of Alex Garland’s cosmic-horror depiction of what it means to be human.

**Movie summary**
The characters in Annihilation are highly skilled and educated female scientists, each proficient in her field and seemingly equipped with a greater capacity for learning than their military counterparts, who met tragic ends within the alien biosphere known as the Shimmer prior to the assembly of the all-female team. The setting is an obscure swampland off an unnamed coast, where a meteorite strikes a lone lighthouse before an expanding, refractive phenomenon begins to spread outward.

The protagonist, known only as Dr. Lena, joins the team after her missing husband returns home, apparently from the Shimmer, only to fall gravely ill shortly thereafter. The team enters this alien landscape in search of the source of the phenomenon that threatens all life on Earth.

**The breakdown and deterioration of fundamental epistemological frameworks in Annihilation:**
The film opens with Dr. Lena being interrogated by a man in a hazmat suit inside a quarantine area. He asks her a series of seemingly mundane questions, to which she repeatedly replies that she does not know. When he finally asks, “Then what do you know?” (Garland, 2018, 00:00:58), the epistemic stakes of the film are immediately established, through which the audience is invited to discover and explore the horror of the unknown.

We learn that the characters are scientists- vetted experts in their respective fields and who prioritize reason, inquiry, and learning over the militaristic approach previously employed by the soldiers who vanished within the Shimmer. In particular, Dr. Lena, a biologist at Johns Hopkins, and the military psychologist Dr. Ventress explicitly frame their decision to enter the Shimmer as motivated by a desire to know and to understand. Lena hopes to save her husband, while Ventress harbors more opaque motivations that gradually reveal themselves.

By establishing these motivations, the film initially presents the characters as possessing epistemic virtues: curiosity, rationality, and methodological discipline, which we might reasonably assume would be conducive to discovering the truth of the alien phenomenon.

This assumption is quickly undermined. Upon entering the Shimmer, the team loses any stable sense of time, memory, and self, regaining consciousness days later with no recollection of what occurred (Garland, 2018, 00:30:00). Neither propositional knowledge nor procedural knowledge functions reliably when their communication systems fail and their navigational instruments become meaningless.

As the expedition progresses, the explorers struggle to preserve any form of epistemic reliability, gradually sinking into a state of epistemic skepticism as they oscillate between awe and despair in the face of the incomprehensible environment (Garland, 2018, 00:38:00). Characters tend to fall back on process-based justification, such as taking samples of DNA, trying to form guard parameters and forming social structures to make sense of what they are learning. This reflects a broadly Kantian attempt to make sense of phenomena through the application of human cognitive frameworks.

Yet these strategies ultimately fail. The Shimmer constitutes a fundamentally hostile epistemic environment in which no belief-forming process can reliably track truth.

One of the film’s most striking allegories is its treatment of mutation. Early on, Dr. Lena remarks on the improbability of a single plant producing multiple species of flowers on separate branches, suggesting a process of continual and accelerated mutation. This refractive mutation is mirrored in the increasingly corrupted biological forms encountered as the team approaches what they call the source.

In parallel, the characters’ personal histories reveal their internal epistemic conditions. As the geomorphologist Cassie describes them, they are “damaged goods” (Garland, 2018, 00:39:54)- a phrase that serves as an allusion to the corruption and instability of both their inner lives and the external world they inhabit. As the story unfolds, the accelerated mutation of their own DNA forces each character to adapt to overwhelming environmental pressures, shedding not only their epistemological frameworks but also their sense of self.

Ultimately, Annihilation asks the audience to embrace a profound form of [[epistemological humility\|epistemological humility]]. The knowledge which gives way to transformation, and understanding is no longer grounded in mastery or explanation, but in acceptance of [[radical uncertainty\|radical uncertainty]].

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How do we hold up epistemic reliability when the environmental conditions for [[reliabilism 1\|reliabilism 1]] are hostile?
2. What kind of [[1. Nodes/epistemic virtue\|epistemic virtue]]s are critical for most efficacious reliabilism?
3. How does experiential knowledge shape reliabilism?
