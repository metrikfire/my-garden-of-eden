**Definition**: Non-intervention research: Research using designs that do not involve an intervention or experimental manipulation.


**Notes**
Non-intervention designs often suggest follow-up experiments to evaluate cause and effect, which in turn suggest other non-intervention designs to describe the workings of the intervention tested experimentally. (Suter 2012, pg. 4)

These descriptions might include participants' reactions or classifications of participants according to greater or lesser treatment influence (effect size) or no influence at all. 

Many non-intervention, qualitative, and descriptive designs are well suited for answering questions about how and why. (Suter, Ch 11, pg. 4)

Educational research is best served by the power of complementary research data. (pg.4)
