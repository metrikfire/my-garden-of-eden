**Definition**:
The ideal L2-self is part of the L2 motivational self-system (L2MSS) which was initially theorized
by Zoltan Dörnyei (2005). The ideal L2-self acts as a powerful motivator as a language learner
tries to address the difference between their current self and future ideal L2-self (Dörnyei,
2009).

**The L2MSS consists of 3 components:**
- Ideal L2-Self: This is the person we would like to become when we speak an L2.
- Ought-to L2 Self: The attributes one believes one ought to possess to meet expectations
and to avoid possible negative outcomes.
- L2 Learning Experience: Motives related to the immediate learning environment and
experience (e.g. the impact of the teacher, the curriculum, the peer group, the experience of
success).

For a learners ideal L2-self to be motivating it has to exist. There are 9 requirements:
1. The learner has an ideal L2-self vision.
2. The ideal L2-self vision is considerably different from their actual self.
3. The vision of their future self is elaborate and vivid.
4. The ideal L2-self self-image is seen as plausible by the learner.
5. The vision is not seen as a definite, there should be some doubt that it will not happen
automatically.
6. The ideal L2-self does not clash with what is expected of them by their social circle.
7. The vision is regularly activated.
8. There is an action plan and strategies in place to help achieve the ideal L2-self vision.
9. The future vision is offset by a feared possible self
